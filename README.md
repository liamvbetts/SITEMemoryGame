## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Although I have two years of experience coding in Java/C++, I have had very little exposure to HTML/CSS/Javascript. I had a hard time understanding the structure
of the index.html file. However, after viewing the additional guidance boxes I felt more confident in how I was implementing the program. Besides the initially learning
some of the rules of the syntax, I really did not have any trouble creating this submission. The directions were clear and concise, and I found my code working very quickly after
writing it (not often the case with some of my other projects!)

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

My questions about web development generally revolve around what it takes to create a user log in and reccomendation system.
Over my gap year, I worked as an international school volunteer teacher in Tonga, and since then I've had an idea for a website
that would match a user with volunteering opportunities, either locally or abroad, based on a brief questionnaire. I would love to 
learn how to implement the functionality required to develop it!

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Since I am a music producer, I would create a full piano and use the program to teach me to play popular songs. I would look for 
a database of songs that use an easy chord structure, assing each of the buttons on the keyboard to a note on the piano,
and use the functionality of the memory game to help me name the notes of each of the keys. I think this would be a fantastic way 
to practice and memorize chords/notes!
